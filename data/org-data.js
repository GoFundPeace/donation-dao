      Catatumbo's social fabric to allow dignified living conditions and 
      development for the people of Catatoumberos. They have coalesced around 
      the protecting and cultivating the territory; respect

      non-fumigation of illicit crops and the eradication of the socioeconomic 
      factors that gave rise to the cultivation of coca; defense of natural 
      resources and care of the environment; the rescue of our cultural 
      traditions; participation in decision-making involving the field; and
